# About this app
This App was created using the Google Map Places API. The user can know his current location and the locations of the nearby buildings (hospitals, banks, supermarkets, restaurants ) and their information. If the user enters a city name in the search field and then presses the search button, he can see the city's location on the map.

I created it with Android Studio version 3.5
The source of icons is https://icons8.de/icons/set/android

 For using this app, you need Google Map API Key. First, you need an account of Google Cloud Platform and create a praject. Then, you need to activate two APIs "Places API" and "Maps SDK for Android". And then, you can use your API key in the project.
 
If this app is displayed on the emulator, the user's initial location (Google's headquarters) will be showed. If the user installs this app on a android phone, his correct current location will be displayed.
